# COVID19
This is a simple code for online data scarping of the virus spread and growth factor.<br/>
Data is read from:<br/>
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 <br/>
Updated by Johns Hopkinz university. <br/>
you can edit the country name but it is for the United States by default. <br/>
We plot total confirmed, recovered and death. There is also a plot for growth factor which is defined as: <br/>
   f=N_today/N_yesterday <br/>
where N is total number of new cases (today is compared to yesterday).<br/>
Thanks.
