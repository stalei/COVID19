# COVID19
This is a simple code for online data scarping of the virus spread and growth factor.
Data is read from:
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
Updated by Johns Hopkinz university.
you can edit the country name but it is for the United States by default.
We plot total confirmed, recovered and death. There is also a plot for growth factor which is defined as:
$f_{growth}=\frac{N_{new cases today}}{N_{new cases yesterday}}

Thanks.
