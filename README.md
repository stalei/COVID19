# COVID19
This is a simple code for online data scarping of the virus spread and growth factor.
Data is read from:\\
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 \\
Updated by Johns Hopkinz university. \\
you can edit the country name but it is for the United States by default. \\
We plot total confirmed, recovered and death. There is also a plot for growth factor which is defined as: \\
   $f=N_today/N_yesterday$ \\
where N is total number of new cases (today is compared to yesterday).\\
Thanks.
